### Running Rust Projects:

#### Using `rustc`:

1. **Compilation:**
   - 🖥️ Open your terminal and go to your project folder.
   - 📝 Type this command, replacing `your_file.rs` with your file's name:
     ```bash
     rustc your_file.rs
     ```
   - 🚀 This makes an executable file named `your_file`.

2. **Execution:**
   - 🏃‍♂️ After it compiles without errors, run this in the terminal:
     ```bash
     ./your_file
     ```

#### Using Cargo:

1. **Creating a New Project:**
   - 🖥️ Open your terminal.
   - 📝 Type this to make a new Rust project:
     ```bash
     cargo new my_project
     ```
   - 📂 This creates a new folder called `my_project` with stuff inside.

2. **Navigating to Your Project:**
   - 🚶‍♂️ Go into your project folder:
     ```bash
     cd my_project
     ```

3. **Writing Code:**
   - ✍️ Use a text editor to open `src/main.rs`.
   - 📝 Write your Rust code here.

4. **Running Your Project:**
   - 🏃‍♂️ Type this to build and run your Rust project:
     ```bash
     cargo run
     ```
